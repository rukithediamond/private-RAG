my first initial github project for AI colab:
steps to implement:
. verify functionality of various vectors db for ingest documents (in the future talk with SQL db)
. talk with documents, use of local llm via providers like h2ogpt,llama.cpp,llama-cpp-python,llm.mlc,gpt4all and than test all in google colab
